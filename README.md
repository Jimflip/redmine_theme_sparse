redmine_theme_sparse
====================

This is the stock redmine theme but it hides the 'top-menu', the 'header', and the 'sidebar'. This theme is very useful for a projector, or flatscreen operation office status view.

At this time the theme does not automatically refresh, but it will in the future.
